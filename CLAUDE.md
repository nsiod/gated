# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Gated is a smart bastion host / access gateway written in 100% safe Rust. It proxies SSH, HTTPS, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Kubernetes connections with centralized auth, RBAC, session recording, and a web admin UI. Ships as a single binary with the frontend embedded via `rust-embed`.

## Build & Run

```bash
# Prerequisites: Rust 1.95.0 (pinned via rust-toolchain.toml), Bun, just

# Backend
cargo build --release                         # Release binary at target/release/gated
cargo build --features mysql,postgres         # With database backend feature flags
cargo run --all-features -- --config config.yaml run  # Run locally (or: just run)

# Frontend (crates/gated-web/)
just bun install --frozen-lockfile            # Install deps
just bun run build                            # Production build → crates/gated-web/dist/
just bun run dev                              # Dev server on 0.0.0.0:8889

# OpenAPI client regeneration (after changing admin or gateway API endpoints)
just openapi                                  # Regenerate TypeScript API clients from Rust schemas
```

## Lint & Check

```bash
just clippy                   # Rust linting (cargo cranky, per-crate, all features)
just fmt                      # Rust formatting (per-crate)
just lint                     # Frontend ESLint (@antfu config)
just typecheck                # Frontend tsc --noEmit
just i18n-check               # Verify en / zh-CN i18n key parity across namespaces
just cleanup                  # All of the above: fix + clippy + fmt + typecheck + lint + i18n-check
```

## Testing

```bash
# Rust unit tests
just test                                     # All crates
cargo test --all-features -p gated-core       # Single crate

# Frontend tests (Vitest)
cd crates/gated-web && bun run test           # All frontend tests
cd crates/gated-web && bun run test:watch     # Watch mode

# Integration tests (Bun, in tests/ directory)
cd tests && bun test                          # All integration tests
cd tests && bun test api/                     # Test category (api, ssh, http, db, kubernetes, misc)
cd tests && bun test api/users.test.ts        # Single test file
```

Integration tests spawn a real `gated` binary via `ProcessManager`, create test fixtures (users, roles, targets) via `AdminClient`, and validate behavior end-to-end. Test timeout is 300s.

## Architecture

### Workspace (18 crates, all under `crates/`)

The `gated` binary crate (`crates/gated`) is the entry point. It wires together protocol servers that all implement the `ProtocolServer` trait. Central dependency injection is via the `Services` struct in `crates/gated-core/src/services.rs`, which holds `Arc<Mutex<T>>` references to shared state (DB, config, sessions, recordings, rate limiters).

Key crate groups (all paths relative to `crates/`):
- **Core**: `gated-common` (config, auth types, shared helpers), `gated-core` (runtime state, services, session management), `gated-db-entities` + `gated-db-migrations` (Sea-ORM models + migrations)
- **Protocols**: `gated-protocol-{ssh,http,mysql,postgres,kubernetes}` — each implements `ProtocolServer`
- **Auth integrations**: `gated-ldap`, `gated-sso` (OIDC), `gated-ca` (client cert issuance), `gated-tls`
- **Web**: `gated-admin` (REST API with poem-openapi), `gated-web` (React SPA, embedded into binary)

### Frontend (crates/gated-web/)

React 19 SPA using React Router v7 with lazy-loaded routes. Three route hierarchies under `/ui`:
- `/ui` — **Gateway**: user self-service (targets, profile, credentials, API tokens)
- `/ui/admin` — **Admin**: management dashboard (sessions, recordings, config)
- `/ui/client` — **Client**: client access interface

State management: TanStack Query for server state, Zustand for client state. UI: shadcn/ui (Base UI) + Tailwind CSS v4. i18n via i18next (en, zh-CN).

### API Type Flow

Rust backend (poem-openapi) → `cargo run -p gated-admin` outputs OpenAPI JSON → `openapi-generator-cli` generates TypeScript-fetch client → frontend imports typed API client. Two separate API surfaces: admin (`/admin/api`) and gateway (`/api`).

### Auth Pipeline

Multi-credential, multi-backend auth: Password/PubKey/TOTP/SSO/Certificate credentials validated against configurable policies (any-single, all-required, per-protocol). Auth state tracked per-session with 10-min TTL and broadcast channels for state changes.

### Database

Sea-ORM 1.0 + sqlx. SQLite default; PostgreSQL and MySQL via feature flags. 22 entity models, 31 sequential migrations.

## Key Conventions

- All Rust code is 100% safe (no `unsafe`)
- Async-first with Tokio runtime
- `anyhow::Result<T>` for error propagation; `thiserror` for typed errors in libraries
- `enum_dispatch` for trait-based polymorphism
- Poem framework for HTTP/API; poem-openapi for auto-generated OpenAPI specs
- `clippy.toml`: `avoid-breaking-exported-api = false`, `allow-unwrap-in-tests = true`
- Frontend uses `@antfu/eslint-config` for linting
- Vite base path is `/ui/`; dev server runs on port 8889

## Database Migrations

```bash
just migrate up                # Run pending migrations
just migrate down              # Rollback last migration
just migrate status            # Check migration status
```

Migrations are in `crates/gated-db-migrations/src/`. Uses Sea-ORM migration framework.

## Project Development

This project uses the **PMA (Project Management Assistant)** workflow for development task management.

### Workflow: Investigate -> Proposal -> Implement

1. **Investigate**: Trace call chains, search related code/config/tests, read `docs/changelog.md` for context
2. **Proposal**: Output current state, proposal, risks, scope, alternatives; wait for approval
3. **Implement**: Execute approved changes, verify, update task/plan status and changelog

<!-- code-review-graph MCP tools -->
## MCP Tools: code-review-graph

**IMPORTANT: This project has a knowledge graph. ALWAYS use the
code-review-graph MCP tools BEFORE using Grep/Glob/Read to explore
the codebase.** The graph is faster, cheaper (fewer tokens), and gives
you structural context (callers, dependents, test coverage) that file
scanning cannot.

### When to use graph tools FIRST

- **Exploring code**: `semantic_search_nodes` or `query_graph` instead of Grep
- **Understanding impact**: `get_impact_radius` instead of manually tracing imports
- **Code review**: `detect_changes` + `get_review_context` instead of reading entire files
- **Finding relationships**: `query_graph` with callers_of/callees_of/imports_of/tests_for
- **Architecture questions**: `get_architecture_overview` + `list_communities`

Fall back to Grep/Glob/Read **only** when the graph doesn't cover what you need.

### Key Tools

| Tool | Use when |
|------|----------|
| `detect_changes` | Reviewing code changes — gives risk-scored analysis |
| `get_review_context` | Need source snippets for review — token-efficient |
| `get_impact_radius` | Understanding blast radius of a change |
| `get_affected_flows` | Finding which execution paths are impacted |
| `query_graph` | Tracing callers, callees, imports, tests, dependencies |
| `semantic_search_nodes` | Finding functions/classes by name or keyword |
| `get_architecture_overview` | Understanding high-level codebase structure |
| `refactor_tool` | Planning renames, finding dead code |

### Workflow

1. The graph auto-updates on file changes (via hooks).
2. Use `detect_changes` for code review.
3. Use `get_affected_flows` to understand impact.
4. Use `query_graph` pattern="tests_for" to check coverage.
